# MemoryGame
A mini memory game against if you ever get bored.

This game is only against human. A game against your computer may be implemented soon.

During the preparation phase, you can choose:
- Between two packs (for the cards)
- Between two levels (the only difference is that in level 2, returning two times the cross card will make you lose)
- The color of the cards
- The color of the images on the cards
- To turn on the timer
- The time of the timer
- The size of the cards board

There are no big difficulties in this version.
